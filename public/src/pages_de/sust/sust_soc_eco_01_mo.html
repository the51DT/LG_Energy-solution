Further, we require our suppliers to establish their own systems for supply chain transparency, risk identification, and third-party due diligence to avoid sourcing of raw materials from conflict-affected and high-risk areas; and to communicate the information on procedures and results of the implementation with us and other stakeholders.

The system enables to identify suppliers that source any of conflict minerals (tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold) and requires them to report through the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT), developed by Responsible Minerals Initiative, on the use of conflict minerals, mineral country of origin and the smelters and refiners being utilized.</p>

These territories are currently controlled by militant groups of insurgents and conquering armies that mine and distribute minerals to secure funds. This practice continues to cause disputes and often results in casualties, human rights violations, and labor exploitation<br>In July 2010, the U.S. Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act which lay the foundation for legal restrictions on conflict minerals. Every company, listed in the U.S securities market, must fairly disclose and annually report the use of conflict minerals to the Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC) by May 31st. Some Korean companies with obligation are also influenced by this Act, as a supplier to the U.S firms.</p>

LG Energy Solution puts in place various strategies to mitigate risk associated with disruption in parts and materials sourcing. Potential emergency cases are categorized by factor that causes supply chain disruption, including natural disaster, workplace accident, suppliers’ management issue such as bankruptcy, layoff or strikes, geopolitical events and related price fluctuation. For each category of emergency case, a formalized process and manual is put in place that encompasses case classification, reporting protocol, operation of emergency taskforce, and mitigation and remediation planning. Mitigation measures are planned in a phased manner – in the short-term, mitigation measures include temporary sourcing of alternative, production plan adjustment; in the mid- to long-term, mitigation measures vary ranging from dual sourcing, alternative/new supplier identification, to the change of manufacturing site. The category-specific processes and manuals are reviewed and updated on a regular basis to ensure effectiveness of product safety and quality management process and to minimize any adverse impact and prevent recurrence of such event.

The assessment program is designed to evaluate each supplier’s quality management system, quality performance and preventive quality control, and rank them in five levels – S, A, B, C and D – based on the score (Q-Score). LG Energy Solution issues certificates and the record of certification is archived and tracked through our Supplier Quality Management System (QMS).<br>

LG Energy Solution also utilizes this ranking system for the "Supplier New Biz. Hold (SNBH)" program. Under this program, suppliers who receive the lowest D for two consecutive years are excluded from our vendor pool and restricted from entering into new business contracts with LG Energy Solution. This measure ensures that we maintain a high standard of quality and performance from our suppliers, and encourages suppliers’ continuous improvement and adherence to our quality management requirements.</p>
