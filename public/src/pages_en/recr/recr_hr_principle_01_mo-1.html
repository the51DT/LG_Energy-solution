                                                To ensure that employees feel valued and motivated, LG Energy Solution has implemented a strong performance-based incentive pay structure. This system is designed to align compensation with the actual performance and achievements of employees, thereby rewarding those who perform  exceptionally. This incentive structure is comprehensive and inclusive, covering all levels (i.e. from entry-level, management to C-suite executives) and all functions (i.e. production, R&D, sales and others) of employees.<br>
                                                In addition to competitive base pay that accounts for individual performance, the employees are offered with various incentives including management performance incentives, personal incentives, and on- -spot incentives. This allows us to properly compensate our members for their contributions. LG Energy Solution complies with all compensation-related laws, including the minimum wage, and operates for all workforce without discrimination based on gender, nationality/ethnicity, religion, and social status.
