If operated for 20 years, this facility is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 244 tons annually, totaling 4,900 tons, and generate an estimated revenue of approximately KRW 800-1,000 million. The revenue generated from this power plant is donated to the “Hope Green Energy Center” to support underprivileged youth in the Chungbuk region and cultivate young environmental leaders among them.
