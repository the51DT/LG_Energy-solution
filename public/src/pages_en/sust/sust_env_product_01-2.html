                                                        Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a technique used to comprehensively assess the environmental impacts of energy and mineral resource use throughout a product’s entire lifecycle, from raw material extraction to disposal (Cradle-to-Grave). LG Energy Solution has adopted LCA since 2019, before spin-off, to evaluate the potential impacts associated with our products. Based on these assessments, we engage with key stakeholders, including customers, to communicate the results. Internally, the results of LCA assessment serve as crucial criteria and tools for calculating the carbon footprint of products, identifying hot spots in raw materials and value chains, and developing medium to long-term strategies for achieving carbon neutrality.

                                                            Based on LCA results measured since 2019, LG Energy Solution has obtained Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) certifications-9 newly acquired in 2024, 25 in total. According to the carbon footprint assessments, although results vary depending on product, supplier, and production location, about 36% of total GHG emissions occur during the cell manufacturing process (electrode, cell assembly, activation, module/pack assembly), while about 64% occur during raw material production and transportation. Therefore, in addition to reducing GHG emissions through energy efficiency and renewable energy use in battery manufacturing, we are also managing and supporting GHG reduction efforts by our suppliers.

It involves third-party certification that inspects the product’s quantified environmental impacts throughout the product’s life cycle, including global warming potential, resource use, water and air pollution, among others. To ensure alignment with global product environmental standards and policies, EPD is developed by applying the internationally recognized standards such as ISO 14020, ISO 14025, ISO 14040 series, ISO/TS 14027, ISO 14046, ISO 14064 series, and ISO 14067.
